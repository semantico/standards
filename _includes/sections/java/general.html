        <h1>General Guidelines</h1>
        <p>In general, we follow the guidelines set out by Sun <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html">here</a>.
            We've decided to adopt Sun's Java Code Conventions because they are sensible, comprehensive and widely used.</p>
        <p>However, there are (and will be further) alterations that are specified by Semantico within this document, so you're best bet is to always look here.</p>
        <p>If you can't find what you're looking for in this document, always assume that you should use the Sun standards described above.</p>
        <p></p>

    <h2>Source File Encoding</h2>
    <p>Source files are encoded using UTF-8</p>
    <h2>Indentation</h2>
    <p>For all code languages, we require indentation to be done via soft tabs (<b>using the space character</b>).
        Hitting <em>Tab</em> in your text editor shall be equivalent to <b>four spaces</b>.</p>
    <h2>Line length</h2>
    <p>Due to expanding screen sizes since the Sun coding standards doc was put together, we operate using a line
        length of <b>120</b> chars (as opposed to 80). This does not apply to the package or import statements.</p>
    <h2>Reformatting of Code</h2>
    <p>If you find code that's formatted incorrectly, it's definitely advisable to use your chosen IDE to optimize the
        formatting and then check the changes in, <i>without</i> doing
        any other changes. Mixing code re-formatting and actual code deltas leads to poor visibility of important changes to the underlying code.</p>
    <h2>JavaDocs and Comments</h2>
    <p>Source files should be accompanied by JavaDocs for the class and all methods, especially public methods.</p>
    <p>Comments should be added where code usage is not immediately obvious, or some business rule is being implemented.</p>
    <h2>Commented out Code</h2>
    <p>
        Commented out code can lead to confusion (see http://nedbatchelder.com/text/deleting-code.html for more detail).
        Avoid checking commented out code into the version control system.
